OVERVIEW

Scriptoria is a text-based adventure game set in the Grand Archive, a vast magical library thrown into chaos after a sudden outbreak of unstable magic. As a Seeker sent by the Guild, the player must navigate corrupted rooms, solve magical puzzles, confront the ink-born entity Biblios, and restore stability before the Archive collapses.

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses a simple text-input system to move through locations, interact with objects, and progress the story.
